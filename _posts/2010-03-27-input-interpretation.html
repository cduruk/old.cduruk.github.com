title: Input Interpretation
---

<p>It really drives me nuts when command line interfaces interpret what I am trying to do but only goes a certain distance.</p>&#13;
<p>Look at this screenshot from YouTube.</p>&#13;

<p>So YouTube is smart enough to realize that I am looking for HD videos but it doesn't seem to be doing that search for me itself. Instead it gives me a link with some ambigous text. Do not get me wrong; this is far and away better than what most search engines in this specific case would do --and YouTube should be lauded for that-- but it's still a bit hacky for my liking.</p>&#13;
<p>Speaking of, I am pretty sure Python takes the cake with it's weird user input interpretation.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>$ python&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; #here is a prompt&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit&#13;
Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit #what?&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; quit&#13;
Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit #really?&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()&#13;
$&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;
<p>That being said, it's at least a bit smarter than the Ruby command.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>$ ruby&#13;
# Yep, nothing. Should have used irb, for some ungodly reason&#13;
^Cruby: Interrupt&#13;
$&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;
<p>But perhaps, it's better to have your input interpretation not so smart. I mean, it can get outright creepy at times.</p>&#13;
