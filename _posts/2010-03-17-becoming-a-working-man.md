title: Becoming a Working Man
---

At around 7:16PM EST on March 15, 2010 I have accepted a job offer. After around 18 years of schooling, I am finally transitioning from being a student to being a (hopefully) productive member of The Real World.

The last few months leading to all this has been pretty hectic, to say the least. After I got rejected from the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon, I found myself in a sticky situation. Foolishly thinking that I would get into the program for sure, I had not been looking for jobs so I had nothing at hand. I was supposed to graduate in a few months and I had no idea where I would end up. And, to top it all, Christmas Break was coming so I had to go back to Turkey so I would not be able to travel or even make decent phone interviews.

Right after I came back to US, I started my job search. I was so scared that I would not have a job after graduation that I initially started with a shotgun approach; I was applying to jobs left and right with my admittedly poor resume, a cover letter that was put together in a hassle and with an overall lack of enthusiasm. Applying to whatever jobs I though I was qualified for, was a bad idea for many reasons, the most important being that it made myself feel _cheap_. I would like to to call this my first stride. And it clearly wasn't working.

So I tried again, this time with a new approach. I made a new resume what I _wanted_ to do. I created some sort of a portfolio to prove that I had what it takes to do what I _wanted_. I made a new cover page. I prepared myself technically and emotionally. It wasn't fun at all times but I knew I had to try my best. And this was my second stride.

And what a difference it made. Not only I started getting the attention of companies that I actually would want to work at, but I actually scored interviews with them. Companies that not only made money (or not even that) but made awesome products. Whereas I was almost dreading to go to interviews in my first stride, in my second stride, I would literally cannot help myself with the excitement of actually just making it to the interviews.

So?;
As I said, it was all pretty hectic. Let me put it in some numbers. In total, both my strides resulted in:

* 5 phone interviews
* 5 on-site visits
* 24 on-site interviews
* 12 flights
* 10309 miles in flight
* 1810 minutes in flight

So, where does it all leave us?

Starting June, I am going to be joining Digg as a software engineer.

It's a job I am excited about, for many reasons. First of all, it's digg. It is one of those sites that everyone — bear with me here — has heard of. Maybe you never used it, maybe you used to use it a lot and don't use it anymore. But I am sure you heard of it. To me, alone, makes digg a great place to work at. I am interested in how people use computers, or anything really. More people use what I work, more fun it is for me.

Secondly, it probably would not be too far-fetched to say that it legitimized many of the _hot_ concepts such as relying on people rather than authoritative news sources for information.

Thirdly, as you may or may not have heard, Digg folks (we?) [are working](http://mashable.com/2010/03/13/new-digg/) on some really cool things and from what I can tell, it is going to have a pretty big impact in the scene. I cannot imagine a better time work at a tech company than something like this.

I am definitely looking forward to becoming a working man, as someone very close to me put it. I always wanted to live in the west coast and the Bay Area especially for many reasons including the weather, the social scene and of course the amazing technology network.

It sure is scary to be thrown out there, into the real world, after the protective bubble of the campuses. I will not have people holding my hand as I did until now; things won't be magically solved by people whose sole jobs are making my life easier as a student.

But damn, it's all super exciting. I am a working man now.
