title: Video Players across Browsers
---

<p>I just realized how different all three major browsers have different default video players for the new, much hyped <code>video</code> tag.</p>&#13;
<h4>Here is Chrome:</h4>&#13;
<p><img align="middle" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzau9vb85X1qazj16.png" /></p>&#13;
<p>It sure has some flaws. The blue bar looks clunky; it is too thick. Also, the blue color is too bright to be almost distracting. Moreover, although the playhead is very clear and there's a timestamp for it, there's no way to tell how long the entire video is.</p>&#13;
<hr /><h4>Firefox:</h4>&#13;
<p><img align="middle" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzaua9jHOu1qazj16.png" /></p>&#13;
<p>I cannot put my finger what is exactly wrong with it but I think it's the playhead; it looks too comical, almost hand-drawn. It sure does look in tune with the Mozilla's current branding, especially on their website but looks slightly off in the browser window itself.</p>&#13;
<hr /><h4>And finally, Safari:</h4>&#13;
<p><img align="middle" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzauakBAVm1qazj16.png" /></p>&#13;
<p>The Safari player is unabashedly reminiscent of the QuickTime interface. The reversed look is professional, maybe even too much so. The playhead and the progress bar (which shows much of the video is loaded) blend a little too much into the black background but that's expected with a video player. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is the the button on the left; a circular arrow with the number 30 in it.</p>&#13;
<p>It's not really clear what it does; it rewinds the video 30 seconds. As much as I can imagine many cases where it would be useful, it's more of a clutter for a casual user than nothing else.</p>&#13;

And kudos to the Panic team for creating such a <a title="Steve American Blog Entry" href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/01/steve-american/">nice blog</a> (and bothering to make sure their videos play on all browsers).</p>
