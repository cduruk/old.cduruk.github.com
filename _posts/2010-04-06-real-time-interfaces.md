title: Real-time Interfaces
---

Admit it or not, for the most part, your product is whatever your users see and use. You might have the fanciest and the smartest backend but it's the user interface that your users will use. If it helps, think of all your backend as an API for your product. Clearly, your API must work --I mean, who'd use Google if their search results weren't creepily good-- but if your UI sucks, you might as well not try.

It's an interesting time to be a front-end developer --which I still consider a title by itself-- right now. With proliferation of browsers that can run JavaScript at respectable speeds, libraries such as Jquery and Prototype taking care of the technical cruft of asynchronous scripting (and JavaScript in general), for a lot developers creating interactive, AJAXy interfaces has become norm rather than another buzzword on your resume.

However, the more interesting thing is the wide acceptance of such technologies by the general public. Before I divulge more about this, let me tell you where I am coming from:

I have initially started thinking about this issue after using Quora for a bit. For those who don't know, Quora is essentially a Q&amp;A site with one of the sleekest implementations I have ever seen on the web. I am not talking about the visual looks or branding (all of which are pretty amazing too) of Quora. It's how the entire website feels alive at all times, especially when you start contributing to the site actively. It's an amazing feat of engineering and UI design.

It's hard to talk about what excites me about that site without showing an example. Luckily, some 400 million users, most likely including yourself dear reader, is familiar with something similar.

Facebook, especially with their latest iteration of UI, seems to have jumped on the real-time updates of a webpage bandwagon. Leave your newsfeed on and you can just watch all the new stuff piling in to your page in front of your eyes. Messages and notifications show up at the top; instantly. Leave the page open long enough and you can see how even the "Posted 2 minutes ago" like notifications update themselves too. It's just alive.

Think about that for a second. I am not saying that such technologies did not exist before; my point is that such technologies are slowly becoming the norm rather than the cool du jour.

I am getting a bit off-topic but my over-arching point is that UI conventions and what is acceptable is changing extremely fast on the web. A few years ago, people wanted their forms immediately submitted and votes immediately reflected on their favorite social news site. Now, it's not only what the user does should happen instantly, but the users also want to be on the receiving end without having to do anything.

I am not saying the technology for that didn't exist before but that's irrelevant. To me, the word _technology_ itself is a buzzword that I wish I could avoid using for the most part. I know, on a high-level how the real-time updates at Quora and Facebook work. With enough time, I would probably be able to create something similar myself; at least as a proof-of-concept. Proof-of-concepts are however just what they are. They are proofs, not implementations used by real people.

If it helps, think of how Apple pretty much legitimized touch-screens, first on small mobile devices and now on portable computers in general. Capacitive touch-screens existed for years but it took a really amazing implementation to get them accepted by the general public. Love or hate Apple as much as you want but iPhone has set the bar every other consumer touch-screen implementation is judged by.

Sites like Gmail, Twitter, Quora and of course Facebook is on their way to legitimize real time updates on web pages. In fact, considering how popular Facebook is, it'd be pretty safe to say that real-time user-interfaces are here.

It'd be naive to say real-time, interactive interfaces have captured people's attention as much Apple did with their iPhone. But people notice speed; they want their websites to work faster and soon they will all demand that their websites give them the information without them asking for it.
