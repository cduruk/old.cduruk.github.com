title: Microsoft Outsci-fied Sci-Fi

Justin Timberlake's music is one of my guilty pleasures and I think most of his music videos are pretty quality too. After hearing the "Technology" song on radio, it occurred to me that I have never seen the video so I looked it up and started watching.

And while watching this part of the video where the guy uses some sort of a fancy holographic or touch-screen, it just hit me that with Project Natal, Microsoft essentially went beyond what science-fiction writers would be possible. I am not talking about the transparent screens or holograms or other things. I am talking about the way user interacts with the machine (which is clearly highly inspired by the well-known Minority Report interface).

Look at the guy's hands; he is wearing gloves which supposedly helps the camera track his hands. Same with Tom Cruise on Minority Report.

Some ambitious person at Microsoft must have decided that having to have the users wear a glove is going to be a big enough barrier of entry to their motion control system and they went with tracking body movements with nothing but a camera.

_That is just crazy._

 Well, it is true that I had no experience with Natal whatever. Maybe it really sucks.

That would be bad. A worse case scenario though would be that it doesn't suck entirely but just a little, which is really possible considering this is a motion sensing system. It's one thing when Natal cannot track your movements at all; you'd just not buy it or get any enjoyment at all. But imagine it tracking your movements _almost_ entirely right.

Unfortunately, real life doesn't work like that. Think about the times you _almost_ picked something up or _almost_ put that small piece where it belonged. Those experiences are frustrating, probably more so than failing entirely.

Or imagine a scenario where the system picks up your motions perfectly but it's ever so slightly delayed that what you are doing is reflected in the game later. I am not sure if there is any real time equivalent to that (save for people with certain types of brain damage who I know have distorted perceptions of time). But I cannot imagine it being anything but frustrating.

I digress. But only slightly. The smart people at Microsoft must have known all these. They must have spent a lot of hours working out the kinks, making sure it just works. I am not a Microsoft fanboy, far from it. But I cannot help myself from being impressed and wowed by their ambitious goal.

Project Natal, by far, is the single most technological device that I have a craving for.
