title: Microsoft Outsci-fied Sci-Fi
---

<p>Justin Timberlake's music is one of my guilty pleasures and I think most of his music videos are pretty quality too. After hearing the "Technology" song on radio, it occurred to me that I have never seen the video so I looked it up and started watching.</p>&#13;
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzcphzUL2O1qazj16.png" alt="Gloves" /></p>&#13;
<p>And while watching this part of the video where the guy uses some sort of a fancy holographic or touch-screen, it just hit me that with Project Natal, Microsoft essentially went beyond what science-fiction writers would be possible. I am not talking about the transparent screens or holograms or other things. I am talking about the way user interacts with the machine (which is clearly highly inspired by the well-known Minority Report interface).</p>&#13;
<p>Look at the guy's hands; he is wearing gloves which supposedly helps the camera track his hands. Same with Tom Cruise on Minority Report.</p>&#13;
<p>Some ambitious person at Microsoft must have decided that having to have the users wear a glove is going to be a big enough barrier of entry to their motion control system and they went with tracking body movements with nothing but a camera.</p>&#13;
<p><em>That is just crazy.</em></p>&#13;
<p> Well, it is true that I had no experience with Natal whatever. Maybe it really sucks.</p>&#13;
<p>That would be bad. A worse case scenario though would be that it doesn't suck entirely but just a little, which is really possible considering this is a motion sensing system. It's one thing when Natal cannot track your movements at all; you'd just not buy it or get any enjoyment at all. But imagine it tracking your movements <em>almost</em> entirely right.</p>&#13;
<p>Unfortunately, real life doesn't work like that. Think about the times you <em>almost</em> picked something up or <em>almost</em> put that small piece where it belonged. Those experiences are frustrating, probably more so than failing entirely.</p>&#13;
<p>Or imagine a scenario where the system picks up your motions perfectly but it's ever so slightly delayed that what you are doing is reflected in the game later. I am not sure if there is any real time equivalent to that (save for people with certain types of brain damage who I know have distorted perceptions of time). But I cannot imagine it being anything but frustrating.</p>&#13;
<p>I digress. But only slightly. The smart people at Microsoft must have known all these. They must have spent a lot of hours working out the kinks, making sure it just works. I am not a Microsoft fanboy, far from it. But I cannot help myself from being impressed and wowed by their ambitious goal.</p>&#13;
<p>Project Natal, by far, is the single most technological device that I have a craving for.</p>
