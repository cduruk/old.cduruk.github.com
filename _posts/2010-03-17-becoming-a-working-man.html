title: Becoming a Working Man
---

<p><em>This entry is about me finally finding an awesome job and accepting that offer. You can scroll down if you want but where's the fun in that?</em></p>&#13;
<p>At around 7:16PM EST on March 15, 2010 I have accepted a job offer. After around 18 years of schooling, I am finally transitioning from being a student to being a (hopefully) productive member of The Real World<sup>TM</sup>.</p>&#13;
<p>The last few months leading to all this has been pretty hectic, to say the least. After I got rejected from the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon, I found myself in a sticky situation. Foolishly thinking that I would get into the program for sure, I had not been looking for jobs so I had nothing at hand. I was supposed to graduate in a few months and I had no idea where I would end up. And, to top it all, Christmas Break was coming so I had to go back to Turkey so I would not be able to travel or even make decent phone interviews.</p>&#13;
<p>Right after I came back to US, I started my job search. I was so scared that I would not have a job after graduation that I initially started with a shotgun approach; I was applying to jobs left and right with my admittedly poor resume, a cover letter that was put together in a hassle and with an overall lack of enthusiasm. Applying to whatever jobs I though I was qualified for, was a bad idea for many reasons, the most important being that it made myself feel <em>cheap</em>. I would like to to call this my first stride. And it clearly wasn't working.</p>&#13;
<p>So I tried again, this time with a new approach. I made a new resume what I <em>wanted</em> to do. I created some sort of a portfolio to prove that I had what it takes to do what I <em>wanted</em>. I made a new cover page. I prepared myself technically and emotionally. It wasn't fun at all times but I knew I had to try my best. And this was my second stride.</p>&#13;
<p>And what a difference it made. Not only I started getting the attention of companies that I actually would want to work at, but I actually scored interviews with them. Companies that not only made money (or not even that) but made awesome products. Whereas I was almost dreading to go to interviews in my first stride, in my second stride, I would literally cannot help myself with the excitement of actually just making it to the interviews.</p>&#13;
<p>So?</p>&#13;
<p>As I said, it was all pretty hectic. Let me put it in some numbers. In total, both my strides resulted in:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>5 phone interviews</li>&#13;
<li>5 on-site visits</li>&#13;
<li>24 on-site interviews</li>&#13;
<li>12 flights</li>&#13;
<li>10309 miles in flight</li>&#13;
<li>1810 minutes in flight</li>&#13;
</ul><p>So, where does it all leave us? </p>&#13;

<p>Starting June, I am going to be joining Digg as a software engineer.</p>&#13;
<p>It's a job I am excited about, for many reasons. First of all, it's digg. It is one of those sites that everyone — bear with me here — has heard of. Maybe you never used it, maybe you used to use it a lot and don't use it anymore. But I am sure you heard of it. To me, alone, makes digg a great place to work at. I am interested in how people use computers, or anything really. More people use what I work, more fun it is for me.</p>&#13;
<p>Secondly, it probably would not be too far-fetched to say that it legitimized many of the <em>hot</em> concepts such as relying on people rather than authoritative news sources for information. </p>&#13;
<p>Thirdly, as you may or may not have heard, Digg folks (we?) <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/13/new-digg/">are working</a> on some really cool things and from what I can tell, it is going to have a pretty big impact in the scene. I cannot imagine a better time work at a tech company than something like this.</p>&#13;
<p>I am definitely looking forward to becoming a working man, as someone very close to me put it. I always wanted to live in the west coast and the Bay Area especially for many reasons including the weather, the social scene and of course the amazing technology network.</p>&#13;
<p>It sure is scary to be thrown out there, into the real world, after the protective bubble of the campuses. I will not have people holding my hand as I did until now; things won't be magically solved by people whose sole jobs are making my life easier as a student.</p>&#13;
<p>But damn, it's all super exciting. I am a working man now.</p>
