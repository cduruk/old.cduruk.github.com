## About Me
I am Can Duruk, a developer with an eye for design. I am from Turkey, hence the funny name. I like building building user interfaces people love to use.

## Background
Currently, I work at [SnapGuide](http://snapguide.com).

Before, I have worked at [Digg](http://digg.com) and [Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com).

## Elsewhere
I lurk heavily on the internets, mostly going by the moniker `cduruk`.
