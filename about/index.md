## Hi

### About Can
I am Can Duruk, a developer with an eye for design. I am from Turkey, hence the funny name. I like building building user interfaces people love to use.

### Background
I currently work at [Digg](http://digg.com/) as a web developer. Before that, I studied at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu/) getting a double major in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction.
